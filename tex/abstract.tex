\section*{Abstract}

This master's thesis deals with the functional verification of a microcode engine developed by the Computer Architecture Group at the Institute of Computer
Engineering of the Heidelberg University.
It discusses, how the Universal Verification Methodology in combination with Metric Driven Verification can be used to ensure the correct behavior of the
engine. \\
The testbench developed within this work is aimed to generate random stimuli on the fly using multiple tests. 
These tests are developed to address specific functionalities of the engine, but being still generic enough to reach all interesting scenarios. 
The generated stimuli are then used to drive the design under test. \\
Additionally, a transaction-level based reference model is used to predict the behavior of the microcode engine. 
Furthermore, the internal state of the microcode engine is monitored additionally to its interfaces, so the model is even closer related to the behavior of the engine.
Both the collected and the predicted results are then compared to create a self-checking environment.
Finally coverage data is collected to measure the effectiveness of the verification.
